          <p className=" text-center mb-10">The Institute is a part of the <span className="text-[#9A0002]">Tibetan Children’s Village (TCV)</span> , an integrated charitable organization for child care and educational services. True to its initial vision, as set forth by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, the mission of TCV is to ensure that all Tibetan children under its care receive a sound modern education and a firm cultural identity, so they can become self-reliant and contributing members of the community and the world at large. Over the years, TCV has grown into the largest autonomous educational body in the Tibetan community in exile. In several significant ways, TCV has set the pace and tempo of school management, and has consistently worked hard to improve the quality and scope of education at the higher level. The Dalai Lama Institute for Higher Education, Bangalore, is TCV’s latest educational endeavour, and one of the most significant projects ever undertaken by TCV. We welcome your interest in the Dalai Lama Institute for Higher Education!</p>
