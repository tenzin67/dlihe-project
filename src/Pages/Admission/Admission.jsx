          The Dalai Lama Institute for Higher Education (DLIHE) provides a
          holistic environment in which Tibetan students can explore both
          traditional and contemporary disciplines while staying connected to
          their culture and community. This allows DLIHE students to develop
          personally, intellectually, and morally while supported by a solid
          Tibetan cultural foundation. DLIHE students learn to navigate in the
          world through exploration with guest lecturers and faculty, cultural
          explorations with resources in Bangalore, and, eventually, internship
          experiences.

          The curriculum at the Dalai Lama Institute for Higher Education is
          designed to build on the experiences that Tibetan students receive at
          TCV and other Tibetan schools and teach students ways to become
          positively responsible for their lives and their future education.

          Student services at the Institute are designed to broaden the
          studentsâ€™ knowledge of the world and of their place in the world. The
          focus is on guiding students to become self -reliant and productive
          members of society. Students are introduced to other cultures and to
          become active learners by exploring individual interests with the
          guidance of faculty and staff. They are actively exposed to the
          greater world through guest lecturers, library resources and online
          resources while residing in a safe and supportive learning community.
